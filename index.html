            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>Skills</h3> 
                I am very skilled in typing and I am currently able to type 65-70 words per minute. For my whole entire middle school time, I have gotten all A+ and usually one A.

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                I enjoy editing videos and watching edits of tv shows or youtubers. One of my hobbies is to also swim competitively, it is a very hard sport to be able to get faster at and can be time consuming. I also enjoy going to conventions which includes, Vidcon and Beautycon. There, I meet my favorite online content creators.

                <h3>Interests</h3>
                One of my interest is traveling. Traveling to a new place even if it is not far from home is like escaping from worries of school and swimming for me. I have traveled to many states in the United States but have also gone to Caribbean Islands including Jamaica. I also have an interest in editing. I would like to learn better editing techniques and be able to create awesome content. My interest is also photography, it is very fun to go out with friends and snap pictures with them.

                <h3>Family</h3>
                I am the youngest of two in my family. My dad and his side of the family were born and raised in Montego Bay, Jamaica until he was 13 and came to New York, USA. I strive to be like him as well for he is a great swimmer and inspires me to work hard. My mom has always lived in california and met my dad in his later years of living in the United States. I have a sister named Jordan who is now a freshman at Lakewood High School, most of the teachers I have now really liked her presence in the class from previous years. Together as a family we enjoy traveling and going to swimming or triathlon events.
