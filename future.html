        <h2>My Future</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>High School</h3> 
            I have not decided which high school I would like to attend but my choices are either Polytechnic or Lakewood high school. At Polytechnic High School I can be in the CIC program where I have a flexible course of AP classes. I would also learn about World economics and take the difficult languages of Chinese or Japanese. People who have taken those languages have earned scholarships and awards for them. Also Poly has an amazing and competitive swim team that has many accomplishments and I would love to join it. At Lakewood High school I would be in the Merit Scholars Program where I take high level courses including AP and take the language Spanish. Lakewood high school is conveniently near my house and I am able to walk there easily. The lakewood swim team is not as competitive as Poly’s but I would be on Varsity (my sister is on Varsity but I am as fast as her) at Lakewood.

        <h3>College</h3>
        <p>
            For college I have always wanted to go to a school in New York. NYU is one of the options because I want to experience having to live on my own and have a different lifestyles. My dad has always wanted me to go to Columbia, which is a school in New York. But my mom does not want me to go to a school on the east coast, she wants me to stay in California. So I most likely would  have to go to a college in California. I would like to go to a college in San Francisco because I enjoy that city very much. I do not know what pathway/occupation I want, so I would go and just try out different classes.

        <h3>Career Interests</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently not sure what type of career I want to have. I definitely don’t want to be someone sitting behind a computer everyday with a boring job. I would like to be the head of something, not one who is assisting. If I could, I would also enjoy a job where I would travel a lot or experience different cultures. One of the jobs that have interest me in the past though was a CSI, where I’d investigate the crime scene or work in an autopsy of victims.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p> My goal for swimming is to make it into the Junior Olympics (I don’t quite think I would ever make it to Olympic trials). One of my goals is to have a successful life in the future. I hope to graduate as a valedictorian in high school. In college, I want to earn a masters degree (not sure in what fields, I just think it would be amazing to earn one).
