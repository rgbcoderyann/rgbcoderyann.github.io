        <h2>Swimming</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Summary</h3> 
            I have been on the same swim team since first grade. I started competitvely swimming in second grade and have been since. Swimming is a big part of my life for I have created a family on my team and have developed many physical and mental skills from it.

        <h3>College</h3>
        <p>
            For college I have always wanted to go to a school in New York. NYU is one of the options because I want to experience having to live on my own and have a different lifestyles. My dad has always wanted me to go to Columbia, which is a school in New York. But my mom does not want me to go to a school on the east coast, she wants me to stay in California. So I most likely would  have to go to a college in California. I would like to go to a college in San Francisco because I enjoy that city very much. I do not know what pathway/occupation I want, so I would go and just try out different classes.

        <h3>Career Interests</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently not sure what type of career I want to have. I definitely don’t want to be someone sitting behind a computer everyday with a boring job. I would like to be the head of something, not one who is assisting. If I could, I would also enjoy a job where I would travel a lot or experience different cultures. One of the jobs that have interest me in the past though was a CSI, where I’d investigate the crime scene or work in an autopsy of victims.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p> My goal for swimming is to make it into the Junior Olympics (I don’t quite think I would ever make it to Olympic trials). One of my goals is to have a successful life in the future. I hope to graduate as a valedictorian in high school. In college, I want to earn a masters degree (not sure in what fields, I just think it would be amazing to earn one).
