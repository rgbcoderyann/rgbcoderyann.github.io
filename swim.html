            <h3>Skills</h3>
          During my time of swimming, I've learned many skills that help contribute to sports but also everyday life. Here are a few:     
                 <h4>Physical Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Coordination</li>
                <li>Different breathing patterns</li>
                <li>Diving</li>
                <li>Physical Edurance</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Mental Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Stamina</li>
                <li>Realistic Goal-Setting</li>
                <li>Detailed Imagery (ex. able to picture most details in a race)</li>
                <li>Better Focus</li>
                <li>Greater Motivation</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
             <h3>Swimming Goals</h3>
            My goals for swimming range in many different ways. Everyday I go to swim, I set small goals to not stop in a set, or to breathe only a few times during a 50 free. One of my main goals is to get to Winter Age Group Invitationals for the 50 yard free, this year or next year. Another goal of mine is to make it to the junior olympics. In highschool, I would like to be apart of the JV or Varsity swim in freshman year and throughout highschool(my sister got into Varsity in her freshman year). A long term goal of mine is to work hard in swim so I can get into a college with a swimming scholarship. It is very hard so I am also using swimming skills in other water sports to try to get scholarships.

             <h3>More Information On Swimming</h3>
             Swimming is a competitve individual (or team) sport that uses all parts of the body to race through water. It involves four types of strokes which are freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly and backstroke. In swimming, a lot of technique, strength, and determination is put into each race for the strokes. During races there are different distances which can be sprints or long distance swims. Many kids do not believe swimming should be compared to other sports for greatness, but swimming is one of the most known sports in the world. One of the best known olympians is a swimmer named Michael Phelps.
