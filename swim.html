        <h2>Swimming</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>My Swim Life</h3> 
            I have been on the same swim team since first grade. I started competitvely swimming in second grade and have been since. Swimming is a big part of my life for I have created a family on my team and have developed many physical and mental skills from it.

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
          During my time of swimming, I've learned many skills that help contribute to sports but also everyday life.

        <h3>Swimming Goals</h3>
        <p>
            My goals for swimming range in many different ways. Everyday I go to swim, I set small goals to not stop in a set, or to breathe only a few times during a 50 free. One of my main goals is to get to Winter Age Group Invitationals for the 50 yard free, this year or next year. Another goal of mine is to make it to the junior olympics. In highschool, I would like to be apart of the JV or Varsity swim in freshman year and throughout highschool(my sister got into Varsity in her freshman year). A long term goal of mine is to work hard in swim so I can get into a college with a swimming scholarship. It is very hard so I am also using swimming skills in other wwater sports to try to get scholarships.

        <h3>More Information On Swimming</h3>
        <p> My goal for swimming is to make it into the Junior Olympics (I donâ€™t quite think I would ever make it to Olympic trials). One of my goals is to have a successful life in the future. I hope to graduate as a valedictorian in high school. In college, I want to earn a masters degree (not sure in what fields, I just think it would be amazing to earn one).
